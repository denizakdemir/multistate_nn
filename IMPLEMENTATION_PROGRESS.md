# MultiStateNN Continuous-Time Implementation Progress

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Core Continuous-Time Model**
   - `ContinuousMultiStateNN` class that uses Neural ODEs to model the intensity function
   - Matrix exponential approach for transition probabilities calculation
   - Proper handling of intensity matrix constraints (non-negative off-diagonal, zero-sum rows)
   - Support for arbitrary state transition structures
   - Time interval functionality with numerical stability enhancements

2. **Specialized Loss Functions**
   - `ContinuousTimeMultiStateLoss` for continuous-time models with censoring support
   - `CompetingRisksContinuousLoss` for competing risks scenarios
   - Factory function for creating different loss types

3. **Advanced Neural Architectures**
   - Base `IntensityNetwork` class with specialized implementations:
     - `MLPIntensityNetwork`: Simple feedforward network
     - `RecurrentIntensityNetwork`: RNN-based architecture for sequence data
     - `AttentionIntensityNetwork`: Transformer-based architecture for complex dependencies

4. **Bayesian Extension**
   - `BayesianContinuousMultiStateNN` for Bayesian inference with continuous-time models
   - Variational inference with Pyro
   - Support for different prior distributions
   - Proper handling of censored observations in the Bayesian framework

5. **Simulation Utilities**
   - `simulate_continuous_patient_trajectory` function for generating patient trajectories
   - `simulate_continuous_cohort_trajectories` for cohort-level simulation
   - `adjust_transitions_for_time` for proper time-scaling of transition matrices

## What Remains to be Implemented

1. **Training Integration**
   - Update the `fit` function to support continuous-time models
   - Add support for custom time grids during training

2. **Validation Framework**
   - Implement comparative benchmarks against R's msm and mstate packages
   - Add validation against theoretical solutions for simple cases

3. **Example Notebooks**
   - Create comprehensive notebooks demonstrating continuous-time model usage
   - Add examples for disease progression modeling with real datasets

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with continuous-time model documentation
   - Add mathematical background in the documentation
   - Create API reference for new classes and functions

5. **Testing** ✅
   - Comprehensive test suite implemented for all continuous-time model components:
     - Core model (test_continuous_models.py)
     - Loss functions (test_continuous_losses.py)
     - Neural architectures (test_architectures.py)
     - Bayesian extensions (test_bayesian_continuous.py)
     - Simulation utilities (test_continuous_simulation.py)
     - Time adjustment functionality (test_time_adjustment.py)
   - Some integration tests still needed for the entire workflow

## Implementation Notes

The continuous-time implementation using Neural ODEs provides a more theoretically sound approach to modeling state transitions compared to the previous discrete-time approach. Key benefits include:

- More accurate modeling of the continuous-time dynamics of state transitions
- Ability to predict at arbitrary time points without time discretization
- More principled handling of time-inhomogeneous processes
- Better mathematical properties (e.g., transition matrix always satisfies Markov property)

The implementation follows standard mathematical formulations from the field of continuous-time Markov models, with the intensity matrix calculated by a neural network for flexibility.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `train.py` file to support continuous-time models
2. Create example notebooks showing how to use the continuous-time models
3. Add integration tests for the entire workflow
4. Update documentation to reflect the transition to continuous-time models
