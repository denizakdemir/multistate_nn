**Interpreting user request**

The user seems to want a fully functional Python package based on the provided code idea. The phrase "MPR" isn't entirely clear—could it refer to Minimum Project Requirements, Model Package Requirements, Minimal Project Structure, or something like a "Makefile, Pip requirements, and README"? I need to interpret this carefully. The package should be self-contained, include necessary imports, inline comments, and cater to data analysis. I'll focus on creating a formal, professional response with clear structure and depth, including headings and bullet points.

**Clarifying user request**

The user asks for a “fully functional Python package” and mentions "MPR", which remains unclear. It could be referring to "Minimum Project Requirements," "Model Package Requirements," or possibly "Mean Prediction Risk"! Given the context (working with neural networks), it could involve performance-related metrics. They want the package with directory structure, a `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and possibly a `Makefile`. It’s best to clarify the meaning of "MPR", but I think assuming "Minimum Project Requirements" might be a safe start.

**Clarifying the MPR term**

There’s a lot of ambiguity surrounding "MPR"—it could stand for "Minimum Project Requirements," "Model Performance Report," or even "Memory Profiling Report." The user hasn’t given enough context for a definitive answer. Since it's not fully clear, I wonder if I should ask for clarification, but I also want to keep it professional and avoid unnecessary questions. My best guess is that "MPR" refers to minimum requirements for the project like a list of dependencies. I’m planning to proceed with that for now, but I might ask just to be sure.

Below is a fully self‑contained, production‑ready **Python package skeleton** that realises the discrete‑time multistate neural‑network architecture we discussed. Key elements include:

All source files are collected in the canvas titled **“Multistate Nn Package.”** You can open the canvas to inspect, modify, or copy code directly into your project.

### Next Steps

1. **Install locally (editable mode)**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo‑url>
   cd multistate_nn
   pip install -e .[all]      # adds Pyro support
   ```
2. **Run basic unit tests** (add your own under `tests/`):

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
3. **Train a prototype model** (see `README.md` quick‑start).
4. **Extend**: implement additional metrics (e.g., time‑dependent AUC, Brier score), hyper‑parameter search, or richer hierarchical priors.

#### On “MPR”

The file **`requirements.txt`** serves as the **Minimum Project Requirements (MPR)**: a concise, reproducible list of libraries needed to install and execute the deterministic model.  If you intended something different by *MPR*—for example, a *Model Performance Report* template—please let me know and I will provide it accordingly.
